# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben Jia

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of British Columbia, with a passion for data science, machine learning, and building practical full-stack tools.

This GitHub hosts a collection of my academic projects, personal tools, and hobby experiments — from statistical modeling to game bots.
